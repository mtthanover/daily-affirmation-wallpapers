#### I'm not getting any Notifications
- Make sure you've enabled Notifications for the Daily Affirmation Wallpapers app. Go to iOS Settings to make sure they're enabled.
- Notifications are sent shortly after 8am of your phone's timezone. If you choose a different timezone in Settings, you'll receive a notification shortly after 8am of your chosen timezone.

#### I hate getting notifications on my phone - does the app still work without them?
- Yes! While it's not the preferred method, you'll still be able to open the app and press "Set Today's Wallpaper". This will do everything the notification does, just manually.

#### How does Daily Affirmation Wallpapers work?
- Daily Affirmation Wallpapers uses iOS Shortcuts to set your wallpaper. The Shortcut is run in two ways - 1) tapping on the daily notification you'll receive and 2) pressing the "Set Today's Wallpaper" button in the app.

#### Shortcut asks me to input Text before running
- Just ignore it! Press Done on the prompt and it should work just fine. 

#### XPC Error: "XPC Error received on message reply handler".
- This is a known issue with Shortcuts not running properly on iOS. Try force quitting the Daily Affirmation Wallpapers app and the Shortcuts app. If that still doesn't work, try tuning on and off your iOS device.
